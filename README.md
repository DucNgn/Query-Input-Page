## About:
This repo contains the GUI for the Warm-up project. It allows users to query results from the databases. Plus, it prevents users from modifying the data.

## Instruction:
Create a `credentials.json` inside this folder containing the information of the database in this format:

```
{
    "HOSTNAME": "localhost",
    "DB_USER": "root",
    "DB_PASSWORD": "123456",
    "DB_NAME": "Bookstore"
}

```
